To ensure the usability and reliability of the collected data, one Hikvision monitoring camera (iDS-TCV900-AE/25) is deployed at the entrance of Taijia Expressway in Shanxi province in China for image capturing. This camera is installed on the roadside pole with a height of 5.8 meters and uses the infrared flash as the supplementary lighting. The captured images cover two lanes of the expressway, with the resolution being 4096*2160. All images are captured during the period of November 2019 to April 2020.

We have collected 10,000 images of front-view hazmat vehicles, considering three aspects of variations. Firstly, there are totally 24 kinds of vehicles with diverse appearances, as shown in Fig.(a). Secondly, these images are captured under different weather and light conditions, which may severely degenerate the quality of resulting images, as shown in Fig.(b). Thirdly, it is very likely that images are captured with dynamic shooting angles, which also poses some difficulty for hazmat marker detection, as shown in Fig.(c). These vehicle images totally consist of 20,023 hazmat markers, including triangle light markers and license plates with different postures and positions, as shown in Fig. (d). All markers in images are annotated with bound-boxes by LabelImg. It should be noted that though there are a wide range of variations about these images, there is only one kind of label for them, since our focus is vehicle hazmat marker detection rather than classification.
